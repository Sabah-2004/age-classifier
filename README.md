# Age Classifier ðŸ§ ðŸ“·

## About
**Age Classifier** is a smart image analysis tool that automatically classifies people in images into two categories:
- **Toddler** (ages 1â€“3)
- **Adult** (ages 18+)

The model leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to provide accurate age group detection from photos. This can be useful in applications such as smart surveillance, parental control systems, or demographic-based content filtering.
